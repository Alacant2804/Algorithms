# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in JavaScript.

## Merge Sort

The `mergeSort` function in this repository implements the merge sort algorithm, which is an efficient, comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, sorts each half recursively, and then merges the sorted halves.

## Binary Search Tree

The `BinarySearchTree` class implements a binary search tree, a data structure that allows for efficient search, insertion, and deletion of elements. It maintains the property that the left child of a node contains values less than the node's value, and the right child contains values greater than the node's value.

## Hashmap

The `Hashmap` class implements a hashmap, also known as a hash table, which is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array where the value is stored.

## Linked List

The `LinkedList` class implements a singly linked list, a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of elements where each element points to the next one in the sequence.

##Feel free to explore each data structure and algorithm implementation for more details and usage examples.
