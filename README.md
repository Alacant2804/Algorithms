Title: Simple Linked List Implementation in JavaScript

Description:

My project focuses on implementing a linked list data structure in JavaScript, providing a simple yet versatile tool for managing collections of data. A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, each containing a data element and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

My implementation consists of two main components:

LinkedList Class:

Represents the full list and provides various methods for manipulation and access.
Features include appending, prepending, inserting at a specific index, removing at a specific index, popping the last element, checking if a value exists, finding the index of a value, getting the size, and generating a string representation of the list.

Node Class:

Represents individual nodes in the linked list, each containing a value and a reference to the next node.
Used internally by the LinkedList class for constructing the list structure.

Key Features:

Dynamic size: The linked list can grow or shrink dynamically, allowing for efficient memory management.

Versatile operations: Support for various operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and search.

Easy integration: Designed as a standalone class, making it easy to integrate into other JavaScript projects.
